    Reporters should generally be the last step in a Control Room
    process and should have the setting "Start Only After all work
    items from previous steps are either done or failed" set to true.
    This will ensure that the reporter is only called once all of the
    work items have been processed.

    The results are saved as a single output work item as a final
    output of the process. These outputs will be available in the
    Control Room UI and in the future additional features may
    be added to make it easier to work with the results. Currently,
    one feature available is to receive this final output via webhook.

    Alternatively, you could save the results to a file or generate
    an email or other notification.
